Owing to the increased number of natural disasters,
ensuring a resilient operation of power distribution system is
of paramount importance. In this paper, an advanced feeder
restoration approach is proposed to improve the resilience of
power distribution systems to natural disasters. In the proposed
approach, distributed energy resources (DERs) are used to
restore the system’s critical loads when the distribution system is
isolated from the main grid. The proposed restoration framework
aims at maximizing the availability of restored networks making
restoration plan robust to post-restoration failures. A resilience
metric quantifying restoration availability is defined. A graphtheoretic
approach is presented to formulate the restoration problem
as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) while satisfying
grid’s connectivity and operational constraints. The framework
in tested using IEEE 123-node feeder with 5 DERs supplying for
9 critical loads. The simulation results validate the effectiveness
of our proposed strategy in maximizing restoration availability
